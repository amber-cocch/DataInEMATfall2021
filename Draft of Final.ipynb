    "Are there common themes among fix it fics that show what audiences crave that shows lack? To answer this, I will scrape data from Archive of Our Own (Ao3) to compare tags used on “fix it” fanfictions, or fanfictions that aim to give the show a “better” ending, across the shows Voltron, Supernatural, and Star Wars: The Sequel Trilogy. The answer to this question could be used to suggest what themes audiences are wanting to see in media in general and could be used as a recommendation to media writers on how to create “satisfying” endings. \n",

I also decided to exclude any explicit labeled fanfictions for the sake of this being a school project and having to present this data. This works out for the overall mission as well, as all of the fandoms I chose are aired on TV and follow FCC guidelines on how graphic their content can be for TV-14/PG-13."

However, due to the frequency of these tags, it stands to reason that the ships found are legitimate findings that answer my guiding question. It is true to state that creators on Ao3 wanted to see these characters together, and in a few cases, like Voltron, the canon romantic relationships the writers chose to pursue are one of the reasons the fans disliked this ending so much that they felt it needed to be \"fixed.\" However, show writers often have to pander to a diverse audience, making some popular ships on Ao3 an impossibility to pursue as in these examples, these ships are often mlm or wlw. \n",

    "## Conclusions ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular tags overall are Angst, Fluff, Hurt/Comfort, and Slow Burn. Ship name tags are also quite popular, with Destiel, Reylo, and Klance being the ships of choice. When looking at each fandom individually, the tags show that fluff and angst are consistent across the fandoms. Happy endings are a common tag shared between Supernatural and Star Wars Sequel Trilogy, while Volton tags are about building to a romance/ unrequited love. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through these charts, we are able to see what the creators on Ao3 felt needed to be fixed across these three shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voltron ###\n",
    "The Voltron graphs reveals that most creators on Ao3 wrote about the popular ship Keith/Lance (Klance). This ship was not canon in the show, as Lance canonically is interested in Allura. Keith is in 7 out of 15 tags shown on the graph, indicating that he is a popular character. \n",
    "\n",
    "The character Adam is also in the tag list a few times. Adam is a character that was added to the show as a romantic interest for Shiro. This was significant as it was the first homosexual relationship to be canonized in the show. Many fans were disappointed by Adam, though, as he was dead and just added to Shiro's backstory. This explains the inclusion of the \"Adam lives\" tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tags such as hurt/comfort and fluff/angst show that the creators on Ao3 are looking for social interactions between characters rather than action packed sequences. These tags are added to fanfictions where characters work through miscommunications, struggles, and interact on an emotional level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these facts, I would recommend to show runner to include more character connections rather than focusing on action. As a fantasy action show, there still needs to be more human connections showcased throughout with real feeling struggles. Based on the tags listed, viewers do not feel satisfied with the current level of character development. Relationships on the show should demonstrate human struggles as well as triumphs to fulfill the emotional needs of the audience. There should also be more plot lines with Keith, as he is a fan favorite, and to consider if it made sense to include the romance between Keith and Lance, as this is the most popular ship. This leads into the last recommendation, which is to handle mlm and wlw relationships on the show with more care, tact, and emotion. The mlm relationship on the show between Adam and Shiro was not well received, as many fanfictions \"fixed\" their relationship and brought Adam on as a main character rather than a tragic backstory. \n"

    "There is a clear win in 'most popular tag.' The ship tag between Castiel and Dean is by far the most popular, with about 100 more uses than the second most common tag. As discussed previously, the this show actually did include a Castiel/Dean (Destiel) moment in the last season of the show. Similar to Voltron, however, fans were not 100% happy with how this scene played out between these characters. Castiel confesses his love to Dean as Castiel is dying, contributing to the \"bury your gays\" trope, where many show writers will add in a gay relationship and then immediately kill off one or both of the characters. This may have also lead to the prevalence of \"happy ending\" tags seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"happy ending\" tag may also be coupled with the \"s15 ep20 fix-it\" tag. Season 15 episode 20 is the last episode of the series, and although I did not watch this episode, I do know there is a major character death, so the tag could be used to reverse this decisions. However, there is no \"Dean is alive\" tag that is popular, so I am not confident that the character death is what is being \"fixed\" in these fanfictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides some other ships in the show, hurt/comfort and fluff/angst make an appearance in the list. As with Voltron, this indicates more emotions and connections between characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these tags, my recommendations to the show runners of Supernatural would be to introduce the connection between Castiel and Dean earlier in the show to allow these feelings to be explored between the characters. To be put in the perspective of an audience member who wanted to see Destiel, you spent the whole 15 seasons of the show seeing a potential connection between these characters. It is assumed that the show will never canonize a romantic connection, but then, in the final season, they reveal that there were romantic intentions with one of the characters. But alas, this character is now dead and the audience is left to deal with the emotions of this confession as well as the emotions that come with a character death. This can feel unsatisfying, and having an earlier reveal could have rectified this. "

    "The two main plot points being \"fixed\" in this series have to do with Kylo Ren. Based on the tags seen in the chart below, Ao3 creators wanted to see more Kylo Ren and Rey content as well as having Kylo Ren redeemed. This is another series where the show runners listened to fans and added a canon relationship between Kylo and Rey. But, like in the previous show, this relationship was canonized by the confession of love between both characters as they were in mortal danger and one did die. This fact along with the presence of the angst and fluff tags indicate that people wanted to see this potential relationship grow and develop before the final scenes of the movie, allowing for more human moments and conflict/resolutions to happen and strengthen the connection between these two characters. \n",
